**Bugs & Potential Fixes**
- When dragging a selected rectangle, sometimes the amount of mouse movement will be exaggerated and the rectangle will move too far away.
  - Seems to be related to the page being scrolled down, and causing the amount of pixels moved relative to the page top/left to become greater.
- Changing the color of a selected rectangle that was loaded from a previous layout will cause the previous layout to change without being saved.
  - Not necessarily a bug, but may cause confusion.
